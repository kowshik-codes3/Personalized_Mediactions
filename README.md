# Personalized_Mediactions
This project builds a machine learning model to recommend personalized medications based on patient health data. Using Python and scikit-learn, it processes patient features, trains predictive models, and suggests optimal treatments. Designed for healthcare applications, the project runs fully in Google Colab for easy access and testing.
Personalized Medication Recommendation using Machine Learning
This project develops a machine learning model to recommend personalized medications based on patient health data. It uses Python and scikit-learn to preprocess data, train predictive models, and suggest optimal treatments. Designed for healthcare applications, the project runs entirely on Google Colab for easy access and testing.

Features
Predicts personalized medications based on patient profiles.

Complete machine learning pipeline: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation.

Easy-to-run in Google Colab with minimal setup.

Dataset
Patient health data including demographic, clinical, and treatment features.

Synthetic or real-world datasets can be used (adjust preprocessing as needed).

Model Overview
Models: Random Forest, Decision Tree (or other scikit-learn models).

Training: Split dataset into training and testing sets.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

Getting Started
Open the Google Colab Notebook (replace # with your link).

Upload your dataset if required.

Run the notebook step-by-step to train and evaluate the model.

Use new patient data to predict personalized medications.

Technologies Used
Python 3

scikit-learn

pandas

matplotlib

Google Colab

Future Work
Integrate deep learning models (e.g., Neural Networks).

Apply explainable AI (XAI) techniques for better model transparency.
